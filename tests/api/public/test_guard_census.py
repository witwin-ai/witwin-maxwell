"""Guard-convergence gate for the P5 functional-completeness plan.

Walks every ``raise NotImplementedError`` in ``witwin/`` via AST, subtracts the
committed contract-guard exclusion list (docs/reference/fdtd-capability-guard-census.md),
and fails when the remaining *capability* guard count exceeds the committed
budget. Each P5 phase lowers ``CAPABILITY_GUARD_BUDGET`` in the same commit
that removes guards, so the metric cannot silently regress or be gamed by
reclassifying capability guards as contracts without touching this file.
